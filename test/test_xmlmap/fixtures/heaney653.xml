      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Seamus Heaney was born on April 13, 1939, the eldest of nine children,
		  to Margaret and Patrick Heaney, at the family farm, Mossbawn, northwest of
		  Belfast in County Derry. He attended the local school at Anahorish until 1957
		  when he enrolled at Queens College, Belfast, where he studied English. After
		  graduation he taught English at St. Joseph's College in Belfast. </p>
      <p>While at St. Joseph's he began to write, publishing work in university
		  magazines under the pseudonym Incertus. During that time, he joined a poetry
		  workshop organized by Philip Hobsbaum. In 1965, in connection with the Belfast
		  Festival, he published 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Eleven Poems</title>, and in August of that year he married Marie
		Devlin. The following year he became a lecturer in modern English literature at
		Queens College; his first son, Michael, was born; and Faber and Faber published
		
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Death of a Naturalist</title>. This collection earned him the Eric
		Gregory Award, the Cholmondeley Award, the Somerset Maugham Award, and the
		Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize. Marie and Seamus Heaney's second son, Michael,
		was born in 1968.</p>
      <p><title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Door Into the Dark</title>, published in 1969, was a Poetry Book
		Society Choice for the year. In 1970-1971, Heaney was guest lecturer at the
		University of California, Berkeley. He returned to Northern Ireland in 1971,
		and in 1972 he resigned his lectureship at Queens College, moved his family to
		Glanmore, in County Wicklow, and published 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Wintering Out</title>. In 1973 his daughter Catherine Ann was
		born. During this year he also received the Denis Devlin Award and the Writer
		in Residence Award from the American Irish Foundation. In 1975 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">North</title> was published, winning the E.M. Forster Award and
		the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize. During these years at Glanmore, Heaney also
		gave many readings in the United States and England and edited two poetry
		anthologies. </p>
      <p>In 1975 Heaney began teaching at Carysfort College in Dublin, and in
		  1976 he and his family moved to Sandymount in the city. In 1979 Heaney
		  published 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Field Work</title> and in 1980 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Selected Poems</title> and 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Preoccupations</title>. In 1981 he gave up his position at
		Carysfort to become visiting professor at Harvard. In 1982 he won the Bennett
		Award and Queens University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters. He
		co-founded Field Day company with the playwright Brian Friel and others in
		1983. 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Station Island</title>, his first collection in five years, was
		published in 1984. During that year he was elected Boylston Professor of
		Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard. That same year his mother died. </p>
      <p>In 1988 Seamus Heaney visited Emory University where he inaugurated
		  the Richard Ellmann Lectures in Modern Literature. These lectures were
		  collected and published as 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">The Place of Writing</title> in 1989. In 1991 Heaney published a
		new collection 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Seeing Things</title>, followed by the 
		<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="">Redress of Poetry</title> in 1995. In the fall of that year,
		Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>

		and settings copies of the poems "Bog Queen," "Punishment," "The Grauballe
		Man," and "Kinship," with editor's markings and corrections in Heaney's hand.
		There is also a manuscript of a poem "For Daisy," written on the occasion of
		Daisy Garnett's christening. Heaney gave the keynote address during Emory
		University's 2003 commencement and a typescript draft with revisions in his
		hand is also included in this section.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes printed promotional posters, programs, a small group of photographs, and a DVD of an interview with Heaney.</p>

		  to Sebastian Barker from 1981-1991 and relate to proposed readings, an essay
