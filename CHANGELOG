Change & Version Information
============================

The following is a summary of changes and improvements to
:mod:`eulxml`.  New features in each version should be listed, with
any necessary information about installation or upgrade notes.


0.18.0 - Formset Ordering and DateTime
--------------------------------------

* :class:`eulxml.forms.xmlobject.XmlObjectForm` formsets now support
  ``can_order``.
* :class:`eulxml.xmlmap.fields.DateTimeField` is now included in
  available :mod:`eulxml.xmlmap` fields.  This replaces the previously
  officially-unreleased, under-documented and -tested and misnamed
  ``DateField``.  Date-time format handling and whitespace
  normalization contributed by `jheath- <https://github.com/jheath->`_.


0.17.1 - Bugfix Release
-----------------------

* Fixed an error in eulxml.xpath parse that resulted in parse errors
  when other lexers are defined.


0.17.0 - Minor Enhancements
---------------------------

* :class:`eulxml.xmlmap.XmlObject` now supports lazy-loading for XSD
  Schemas.  To take advantage of this feature,
  :class:`~eulxml.xmlmap.XmlObject` subclasses should define an
  ``XSD_SCHEMA`` location but should not set an ``xmlschema``.  
* When :ref:`field <xmlmap-field>` mapped on a
  :class:`eulxml.xmlmap.XmlObject` is deleted, any XPath predicates
  that could have been automatically constructed when setting the
  value will be deleted from the :class:`~eulxml.xmlmap.XmlObject`
  where possible, if they are otherwise empty.


0.16.0 - MODS and PREMIS
------------------------

* Add basic support for `MODS <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/>`_ in
  :mod:`eulxml.xmlmap.mods`.
* Add basic support for `PREMIS <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/>`_ in
  :mod:`eulxml.xmlmap.premis`.
* Minor logging and error handling improvements.

0.15.3 - Minor Enhancement
--------------------------

* Downgrade the lack of an HTTP_PROXY set in the environment from a
  RuntimeError to a Warning with schema validation disabled.

0.15.2 - Bugfix Release
-----------------------

* Fixed an error in the dependency structure that prevented the package from
  being used after installation through PyPI.

0.15.1 - Bugfix Release
-----------------------

* Fixed an error in the dependency structure that prevented the package from
  being installed through PyPI.

0.15.0 - Initial Release
------------------------

* Split out xml-related components (:mod:`~eulxml.xpath`,
  :mod:`~eulxml.xmlmap`, and :mod:`~eulxml.forms`) from :mod:`eulcore`
  into :mod:`eulxml` for easier re-use.
